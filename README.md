# Dart Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Dart programming exercises, starting from beginner level concepts and progressing to more advanced topics. The exercises are organized in a sequential manner, with each folder representing a specific topic or set of concepts. The repository is designed to help learners build a strong foundation in Dart and gradually advance their skills through hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure

- **Numbered Folders**: Each numbered folder corresponds to a set of exercises or topics, arranged in the order they were practiced. These folders cover a range of Dart fundamentals, such as variables, control flow, functions, classes, collections, and more.
- **projects/**: This folder contains complete Dart projects. These projects serve as practical assessments to consolidate understanding and demonstrate the ability to build functional programs using Dart.
- **pubspec.yaml**: The Dart package configuration file, listing dependencies used in the exercises and projects.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and guidance for the repository.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Numbered Folders**: Start with the lowest-numbered folder and work your way up. Each folder contains code samples and exercises focused on specific Dart concepts.
2. **Review Projects**: After practicing the basics, review the projects in the `projects` folder to see how different concepts come together in real-world applications.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Some exercises and projects may require external packages. Use `dart pub get` to install dependencies listed in `pubspec.yaml`.
